# `@prismicio/client` requires `node-fetch`, which attempts to load `encoding`
# and handles the error if itâ€™s not available. However, when the function is
# packaged for Netlify, `encoding` is made into a hard requirement (i.e. no
# error handling if not available). The following line installs `encoding` as a
# dependency before bundling functions to get around this error.
